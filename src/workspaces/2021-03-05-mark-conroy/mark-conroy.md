like: My desk is an original late Georgian desk, which I really like. It was a gift to myself when we bought our house back in 2006. I like the amount of space I have on it, and I've also plenty of storage with the drawers.
change: The height of the drawers is a bit much, so when my feet are resting properly on the ground, the drawers hit off my knees, which makes it not the most comfortable desk for sitting at for hours when typing. I'm sure it would have been lovely to sit here for 20 minutes at a time penning letters in the 1830s, however! I used to use a MacBook pro with two monitors attached and I kind of miss that amount of screen space. That said, a 27" iMac is very accommodating.
